# intellij-blackconnect

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lensvol/intellij-blackconnect)

Simple plugin for IDEA intended to help you to avoid overhead from starting [black](https://github.com/psf/black) process each time you save a Python file.

Instead, on each press of `Alt + Shift + B` plugin will send contents of the current Python file to the [blackd](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/blackd.html) and replace them with the formatted version (if any changes were made at all).

## Features

* Automatic handling of Python type stubs (`.pyi`)
* Configurable options:
    * Hostname and port
    * Preferred line length (default: 88)

## Installation

1. Open this project in IDEA.
2. Choose `Prepare Plugin Module 'intellij-blackconnect' for Deployment` in the **Build** menu.
3.  In **Preferences** window, choose *Plugins* pane and click on the gear icon.

5. Enjoy!

## TODOs

* Publish it in the [JetBrains Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/)
