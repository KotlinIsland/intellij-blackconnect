Simple plugin for IDEA intended to help you to avoid overhead from starting [black](https://github.com/psf/black) process each time you save a Python file.

Instead, on each press of `Alt + Shift + B` plugin will send contents of the current Python file to the [blackd](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/blackd.html) and replace them with the formatted version (if any changes were made at all).

## Features

* Automatic handling of Python type stubs (`.pyi`).
* Ability to trigger on each file save.
* Rough support for Jupyter Notebook files.
* Configurable options:
    * Hostname and port.
    * Preferred line length (default: 88).
    * Skipping sanity checks ("fast mode").
    * Skipping string normalization.
    * Target specific Python versions. 

## Installation

Install it from [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14321-blackconnect) or build from the source code:

1. Open this project in IDEA.
2. Open _Gradle_ side tab and run `buildPlugin` task.
3. After project is built, open PyCharm.
4. In **Preferences** window, choose *Plugins* pane and click on the gear icon.
5. Choose `Install Plugin from Disk` and point it to *intellij-blackconnect.jar* in the `build/libs` directory.

## TODOs

* Spawn **blackd** process if not started already.
* Load applicable **black** settings from `pyproject.toml`
* Make plugin properly [dynamic](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/plugin_structure/dynamic_plugins.html).
* "Live reformatting".
* Automatic detection of applicable Python frameworks.
